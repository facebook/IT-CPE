When adding links which point to resources within git repositories, like
Design Proposals or supporting documentation, please reference a specific commit
and avoid linking directly to the master branch. This ensures that links reference
a specific point in time, rather than a document that may change over time.

Please use the following format for linking documentation:
- [Design Proposals]: <link>
