`node['cpe_safari']` contains a hash of all the settings.

The profile's organization key defaults to `Facebook` unless `node['organization']` is
configured in your company's custom init recipe.

To provide your own custom setting, add the key you wish to manage to the hash:

`node.default['cpe_safari']['HomePage'] = 'http://www.facebook.com'`

You can see keys that can be managed by looking at the preferences domain:
`defaults read com.apple.safari`
