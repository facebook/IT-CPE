cpe_launchd Cookbook
=========================
This is a cookbook that will manage all of the launch daemons/agents used with
chef.

Requirements
------------
Mac OS X


Attributes
----------
* node['cpe_launchd']
* node['cpe_launchd']['prefix']

Usage
-----
Include this recipe and add any launchd items in the format shdown in the
example below.

**Note:** Ensure that you override the default value of `node['cpe_launchd']['prefix']`
in a recipe (like a custom company_init). If you do not do this, it will assume 
a label prefix of `com.facebook.chef`.

**THIS MUST GO IN A RECIPE. DO NOT PUT THIS IN ATTRIBUTES, OR IT MAY CAUSE PAIN
AND SUFFERING FOR YOUR FLEET!**

If you are creating a new launchd, in your recipe add a key to
node.default['cpe_launchd'] that is the name of the label of the launchd that
you would like to create and the value should be the key found in the launchd
docs on docs.chef.org

    node.default['cpe_launchd']['com.facebook.chef.CPE.chefctl'] = {
      'program_arguments' => ['/opt/scripts/chef/chefctl.sh'],
      'run_at_load' => true,
      'start_interval' => 1800,
      'time_out' => 600
    }

If you are porting a daemon over from the old way of managing services you can
used to old label name and we will take care of pre-pending com.facebook.chef,
and delete the old daemon for you. Also this shows how to add a key to a set of
launch daemons

    script = '/Library/scripts/launch_daemon_init.sh'
    {
      'com.CPE.daily' => {
        'program_arguments' => [ script, 'daily' ],
        'start_calendar_interval' => { 'Hour' => 10 },
      },
      'com.CPE.every15' => {
        'program_arguments' => [ script, 'every15' ],
        'start_interval' => 900,
      },
      'com.CPE.hourly' => {
        'program_arguments' => [ script, 'hourly' ],
        'start_interval' => 3600,
      },
      'com.CPE.startup' => {
        'program_arguments' => [ script, 'startup' ],
        'run_at_load' => true,
      }
    }.each do |k, v|
      node.default['cpe_launchd'][k] = v
      node.default['cpe_launchd'][k]['time_out'] = 14400
    end
