# Contributing to IT-CPE

**note**
Our refactored cookbooks in `itchef/` depend on `fb_` cookbooks maintained by
a different Facebook team. We include them in this repository for convenience,
but to contribute to cookbooks prefixed with `fb_` please check out
[this repo](https://github.com/facebook/chef-cookbooks/).
